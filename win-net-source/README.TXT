The files in this directory and its associated subdirectories contain
the source code from the book ``Accelerated C++: Practical Programming
by Example'' by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo (Addison-Wesley 2000,
ISBN 0-201-70353-X).  They are mechanically extracted from the files
that are used to produce the book.  Accordingly, they should match the
book exactly--specifically, the fifth printing, which isn't out yet.

In addition, we have added main programs, test data, and makefiles to
enable you to compile and run the code.

These files compile and run under Visual Studio.NET.  If you have
an earlier version of Visual Studio, please use the version of the
source code from http://www.acceleratedcpp.com that contains the
appropriate workarounds.

For each chapter in the book, there is a corresponding directory that
contains the source code from that chapter.  Assuming that your
system is configured correctly, you should be able to go into any of
these directories and say

	nmake

to compile the programs,

	nmake test

to execute them, and

	nmake clobber

to remove all the files that were generated during compilation.



All of the files in these directories are copyrighted by AT&T and
Barbara E. Moo, and they come with absolutely no warranty whatsoever.
Permission is hereby granted to use these programs for educational
purposes.

We would like to know about errors in these files and suggestions for
making them easier to use with other compilers.
